1. In Section II, we update Eq.(4) to emphasize that $k^\mu$ is a function of the asymptotic frequency and the radial coordinate. Thus the logic is more obvious when we later use it.

2. In Section III, we added more explicit definition of our variables, and updated Figure 1 and 3 to better represent their roles in the geometry.

3. In Section III, we corrected a typo in a subscript in Eq.(8). It correctly represents the frequencies seen on earth now.

4. In the end of Sec.IV, we added detail explanations for the origin of every terms in Eq.(13).

5. Through out the paper, we remove superfluous equation numbers.

6. We split Sec.V into two subsections. The first subsection describes the strength and shape of our effect as measured by the change in time-of-arrival of pulsarâ€™s signal. The second subsection discusses how likely to have a good candidate for our effect to happen and be observed.

7. In Sec.V.A, We enhanced the connection of this subsection both to the previous one where we derived our results, and to Figure 4 where we presented a few examples for difference values of $\theta$. We explicitly pointed out that the jumps in Figure 4 are due to the pulsar feeling a new acceleration.
